  <p>HackerRank is a tech company[1] that focuses on competitive programming challenges for both consumers and businesses, where developers compete by trying to program according to provided specifications.[2][3] HackerRank's programming challenges can be solved in a variety of programming languages (including Java, C++, PHP, Python, SQL, JavaScript) and span multiple computer science domains.[4]

On the consumer side, when a programmer submits a solution to a programming challenge, their submission is scored on the accuracy of their output. Programmers are then ranked globally on the HackerRank leaderboard and earn badges based on their accomplishments to drive competition among users. In addition to individual coding challenges, HackerRank also hosts contests (often referred to by HackerRank as "CodeSprints") where users compete on the same programming challenges during a set period of time and are then ranked at the conclusion of the event. HackerRank is part of the growing gamification trend within competitive computer programming[5] and the consumer-side of their website is free for coders to use.</p>

  <p>CodeChef was started in 2009 as an educational initiative for the programming community by Directi, an Indian software products company. Today, CodeChef is one of the world’s largest and popular global competitive programming platforms preferred by student & professional programmers. In 2020, CodeChef was added under the aegis of the Unacademy brand.

CodeChef promotes constant learning and friendly programming competitions for its users, along with the support of its large community of problem curators.

CodeChef was created as a platform to help programmers make it big in the world of algorithms, computer programming, and programming contests. It hosts three featured contests every month (Long Challenge, CookOff, LunchTime & Starters) and gives away prizes and goodies to the winners as encouragement. Apart from these, the platform is also open to the entire programming community, especially academic institutes, and student bodies, to host their own contests. Major institutions & corporates across the globe use CodeChef’s platform to host their contests, internal & external coding assessments. On average, 30+ external contests are hosted on CodeChef’s platform every month.

CodeChef also partners with schools, colleges, and student groups to create local CodeChef Chapters, meet-ups, orientation sessions & programming workshops. In addition, CodeChef sponsors coding contests and teams of Indian programmers as part of its Go for Gold Initiative for ICPC & IOI.</p>
